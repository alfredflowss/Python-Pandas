Conclusions drawn from the Data set 
Gender:
•	I can conclude from the data that more Males purchase items as compared to females in a ratio 11:1 on number of purchases.
•	It shows that more Males are interested in the items on sale and from a marketing standpoint I will advertise to males to keep their interest going and my revenue coming in. I will also send out a survey to females to better understand their interests and develop items based on the data I gather from their interests.
Age Groups:
•	For the age groups I can see that more the age bracket 20 – 24 has the most purchases closely followed by ages 15 -19. Which will be a pointer to the age groups to market the items to. My thoughts will be teens just out of high school, college students and young professionals should be marketed to keep their interest up.
•	Also, I will investigate the items the other age groups are interested in by gathering data on interests about those age groups and create an item they can be interested in.

Top Spenders:
•	From the data we can see that the top spender (Lisosia93) purchased 5 items. I would consider encouraging them to spend more by creating points and reward systems that will keep them coming back for more items and reward their loyalty. Also, since they get rewards it will be easy for them to market the incentives, they get to their age groups which will in turn bring more customers.
Top purchased Item:
•	The top purchased item was (Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm) I will send out surveys to find out why this item was the most purchased the most and try to bring elements of this item into the other items
